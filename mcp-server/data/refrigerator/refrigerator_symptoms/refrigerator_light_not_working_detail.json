      "instructions": [
        "Unplug your refrigerator and locate your door light switch. The location of the switch varies depending on the model of your refrigerator, but it is usually located somewhere near the top of the door opening. The switch is often mounted into the interior plastic liner and care should be taken when removing it to prevent damage to the liner.",

      "description": "If your model has an ice and water dispenser with a light bulb you should first verify that the bulb is good. These lights are normally low wattage and are not designed to be used as night lights. Extended periods of usage will typically cause premature failure of the bulb or damage to the socket. Most models will have an on/off switch on the control panel and that may be defective. You can check the switch for continuity with a multi-meter. The lamp or bulb socket may also be defective and the control plate will need to be removed for inspection.",
      "instructions": [
        "Disconnect your refrigerator from the power source before beginning.",
        "Locate and remove your control panel cover to access the on/off switch.",
        "Remove the on/off switch from the appliance in order to test it.",
        "Set your multi-meter to the Rx1 setting and place the probes on the switch’s terminals. You should receive a reading of zero. With the probes still on the terminals press in on the switch, the reading should change to infinity.",
        "If your tests produce results different from those above, you will need a replacement dispenser door switch."
